About BCS
===
BCS stands for **B**ig **C**ollection **S**torage. This software package makes it possible to upload & download files to an FTP server with metadata attached. 

It uses a MySQL database to store the metadata and let you search in the collection/archive of all the files (like movies, series etc.).
This way it's easy to manage large amount of files and content.
